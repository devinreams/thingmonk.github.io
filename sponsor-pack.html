<h1 class="text-center">ThingMonk 2016 Sponsorship Opportunities</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>ThingMonk is another unique conference from the team that brought you Monki Gras and Monktoberfest. Now in its fourth year, ThingMonk is the conference that IoT developers and designers, from London and further afield, attend.</p>

<p>ThingMonk will be held on September 13th and 14th 2016 in London. This year we are also running a Day 0 event with a half day of talks in association with the Eclipse Foundation, followed by a pre-event coding workshop (hackathon) running for the afternoon and evening of September 12th. The coding workshop will be the culmination of a series of online events and promotions beginning in June 2016.</p> 

<p>The event bridges Web Startup Internet of Things communities with their peers in the Industrial Internet/Machine to Machine to Machine space. We bring elite developers and practitioners together, fostering cross-sector collaboration.</p>

<p>2015 was the year in which the Internet of Things has moved front and center for business. In 2016 business is trying to understand and capitalise on the the opportunities for innovation. ThingMonk is at the very forefront of this movement.</p> 
<p>This year’s themes include:</p>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; - Data, Analytics and Visualisation: how do we use, present and aggregate IoT data at scale<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; - Machine Learning and IoT <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; - Platforms at Scale for IoT<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; - Time Series and IoT</br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; - Design and IoT:  designing for users, their context and scale, a product management revolution</br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; - Industrial IoT/Industry 4.0 - how manufacturing is being reconfigured as software<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; - Full stack IoT: how connected devices, platforms, services and data come together<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; - IoT Programming Models<br />
    </p>
<p>ThingMonk celebrates both hacker culture and industrial design, web and mobile. We’ll look at the “boring” side of logistics, the kind that pays the bills and puts food on the table. From agile to big data to machine to machine comms, continuous deployment to Big Data, developers are currently building the future we’ve dubbed the Internet of Things. The alpha geeks are already making the future.<p>

<p>ThingMonk itself will run as a single track conference over 2 days.  We’ll kick off with data and IoT on September 13th, and the conversation will continue with an evening event curated by RedMonk.</p>

<p>ThingMonk 2015 will be a signature event, and experience to remember. We don’t allow pitches, we don’t sell speaking slots, and every talk will be created exclusively for the event, video recorded to scale distribution.</p> 

<h2>Why Sponsor?</h2>

<p>ThingMonk will be fun, informative, but most importantly will bring different communities together, in a high profile developer and practitioner conference. This is a unique opportunity to reach an elite audience of technical resources that transcend traditional developer categories. The Internet of Things will be built by software developers - the people that come to this event - and we’ll have 180 attendees for this years event.</p>
