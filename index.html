        ThingMonk is the developer conference for people building the internet of things. We bring together the technologists building the core infrastructure for IoT for 2 days of awesome, unique talks.

        We're about the makers, people turning ideas and concepts into systems, platforms and communities.

        This year we're also featuring an extra "Day 0" event, including a half day conference within a conference dedicated to the Eclipse Foundation's IoT ecosystem, and back by popular demand, a half day into evening hackday with Coding by Candlelight.
