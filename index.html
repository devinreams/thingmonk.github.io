<h1 class="text-center">ThingMonk 2016<span>Developers, Data, Design: The New Industrial</span></h1>
    <p>ThingMonk is the developer conference for people building the internet of things. We bring together the technologists building the core infrastructure for IoT for 2 days of awesome, unique talks.</p>
    <p>We're about the makers, people turning ideas and concepts into systems, platforms and communities.</p>
    <p>This year we're also featuring an extra "Day 0" event, including a half day conference within a conference dedicated to the Eclipse Foundation's IoT ecosystem, and back by popular demand, a half day into evening hackday with Coding by Candlelight.</p>
    <p>ThingMonk 2016 will be held in the heart of Shoreditch at Shoreditch Studios, 37 Batemans Row, EC2A 3HH</p>
