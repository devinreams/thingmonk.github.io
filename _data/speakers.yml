  talktitle: The Moment Seizes
  talkabstract: Long nows, making it how you imagined and the Internet of Things. Let's look 400,000 years into the past, through now, and cast forward in to the future. Let's talk about the Internet of Things from the moment. Let's stop, and reflect for just a second, about how shifting our perspective can change the ways that we invent, the ways that we tinker, the ways that we bring delightful future possibilities in to being. <p > In this talk, you'll learn about a summary of the entire history of human technology and what it can teach us, going forward, about how we sustainably build the Internet of Things.

  talktitle: The Little Things of Horror
  talkabstract: The current age where privacy is no longer regarded as 'a social norm' may not long survive the coming of the Internet of Things. To a lot of people the digital Internet still isn't as real as the outside world. But it's going to be a different matter altogether when your things tattle on you behind your back. <p> If everything is smart, everything will soon be measuring, calculating, and weighing your life. Suddenly its not just your email, or the photographs of your cat, but your heart rate, your respiration rate, how, and who, you slept with the night before.  <p>But the rush to connect devices to the Internet has led to sloppy privacy, and sloppy security. That can't continue. We therefore will pick over the Internet of Things battlefield of the last couple of years and point out poor architectural choices, poor decisions, and poorly secured things. The hope is that these battle stories can inform future architectures, and make hindsight the best foresight.

  talktitle: The 7 Habits of Highly Diverse Communities
  talkabstract: IoT is transforming our societies. But how do we ensure we don't end up solving IoT problems for just the elite, or a tiny percentage of society? Fortunately there are diverse communities out there we can learn from. This talk distils 7 habits learnt from these communities and a framework for sustaining diverse IoT communities. The more diverse our IoT communities the more secure and resilient society will be.

  talktitle: The (Connected) House of Horrors - Why you should run screaming from the Internet of Things in a domestic setting
  talkabstract: I've connected as much of my house as I can to the Internet of Things. This is the story about how I nearly burned down my house, opened my network to Chinese hackers, wrecked my sanity, electrocuted myself, spent far too much money, automated my domestic chores, electrocuted myself again, spent even more money, drilled holes in my home, filled in those holes and drilled some more holes, hacked my security cameras, bought kit from a start-up which went bust, alienated my family, and generally had a terrible, terrible time.  But my robot vacuum cleaner now tweets - which is pretty cool, I guess.

  talktitle: Building the Web of Things - Node.js, the Web and the IoT
  talkabstract: Because the Internet of Things is still new, there is no universal application protocol. Fortunately, the IoT can take advantage of the web, where IoT protocols connect applications thanks to universal and open APIs.  <p> In this talk we'll look at "Building the Web of Things", a book introducing developers, tinkerers, makers and product developers to using cutting-edge and open web technologies to build the IoT. This step-by-step book teaches you how to use web protocols to connect real-world devices to the web, including the Semantic and Social Webs.  <p />In particular, we will cover:<p /><ul><li>Introduction to IoT protocols and devices<li>Connect electronic actuators and sensors (GPIO) to a Raspberry Pi<li>Implement standard REST and Pub/Sub APIs with Node.js on embedded systems<li>Learn about IoT protocols like MQTT and CoAP and integrate them to the Web of Things<li>Use the Semantic Web (JSON-LD, RDFa, etc.) to discover and find Web Things<li>Share Things via Social Networks to create the Social Web of Things<li>Compose physical mashups with EVRYTHNG, Node-RED, and IFTTT

  talktitle: Just because you can doesn't mean that you should
  talkabstract: Big data! Fast data! Real-time analytics! These are buzzwords commonly associated with platform offerings around IoT.  <p />Although the Law of large numbers always applies, just because you can deploy more sensors doesn't automatically mean that you should. After all, they cost money, bandwidth, and can be a pain to maintain. On the example of the Westminster Parking Trial, I'd like to show how analytics on preliminary survey data could have reduced the number of deployed sensors significantly.<p />  A similar logic goes for fast and real-time analytics. While being advertised as killer features, many people new to IoT and analytics are not even aware that they might get away with batch processing. On the example of flying a drone, I'd like to discuss for which use cases I'd apply edge processing (on the drone), stream or micro-batch analytics (when data arrives at the platform) or work on batched data (stored in a database).
