  talktitle: Towards an Open IoT Stack for the Cloud
  talkabstract: Throughout the last years the open source community has produced a lot of valuable technology for implementing IoT applications. However, most of this technology still requires a lot of low-level knowledge in order to make proper use of it. Now the time has come to take this technology to the next level. <p>Let me tell you about the latest efforts within the IoT Working Group at Eclipse to create an open source based stack of components for implementing IoT solutions at cloud scale.
